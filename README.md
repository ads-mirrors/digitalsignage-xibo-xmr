This is the Xibo Message Relay (XMR) repository.

XMR is a php application built on ReactPHP/Ratchet which acts as a push message exchange between the Xibo CMS and 
connected Xibo Displays . It doesn't do anything beyond forward messages from the CMS to either a WebSocket or 
a ZeroMQ pub/sub socket.

It is packaged into a PHAR file which is included in the [Xibo CMS](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms) 
release files.

**If you are here for anything other than software development purposes, it is unlikely you are in the right place.
XMR is shipped with the Xibo CMS installation and you would usually install it from there.**


## Installation
XMR can be run using Docker and Compose, for example:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  xmr:
    image: xibosignage/xibo-xmr:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # WebSocket
      - "9505:9505" # ZMQ Pub Socket
```

You may also build this library from source code:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `./build.sh`
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`



You may also reference this code in your own projects via Composer:

```bash
composer require xibosignage/xibo-xmr
```
